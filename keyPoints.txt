1) define actions in action file
2) these actions will be handled by reducer in reducer file
3) combine all reducers in rooteducer file because we can have only one rootreducer so we combine 
   all reducers in one rootreducer.
4) now make a store in store file and add this rootreducer into this store.
5) wrap the App component with Provider tag and pass it store as a props
   example 
	 <Provider store={store}>
  	  <App />
         </Provider>
6) now select that reducer with useSelector and call the function with useDispatch in any component
   as per your requirement.
7) import both usedispatch and action function in every component where you want to create any action
8) call dispatch function with parameter that action function call.
